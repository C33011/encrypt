# encrypt
This is a proof of concept for an encryption program that pipes a file input, generates a unique key, and encrypts it with said key. As of now, it only serves as a "per-session" encryption system.
## Changelog
- V0.1 - Redid programming to use a UI from TKinter and cryptography from fernet to overhaul functionality. Generates a unique key upon the first encryption, which can then be used to decrypt text.
- V0.01 - Inital release
