This is a proof of concept for an encryption program that pipes a file input, generates a unique key, and encrypts it with said key. As of now, it only serves as a "per-session" encryption system.
The proof of concept code is also primarily from a tutorial on python encryption, listed form BroCodes youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsLBErLWBhA
